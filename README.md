# her-art-space

Her art space is an image uploading web app where parents/ guardians/ childminders can upload childrenâ€™s artwork pictures with a description and date. This eliminates the need to save the hard copies.
Say goodbye to the parents guilt everytime you throw the artwork brought back home from nursery and schools, and say hello to a well organised web app where you can see the digital copies of your child's artwork with date and description.
